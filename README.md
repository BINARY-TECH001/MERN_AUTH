# MERN Stack Authentication System

This project is a robust authentication system built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides essential features such as user registration, login, password reset with email verification, and OTP-based password reset functionality. This system ensures a secure and seamless user experience, making it an ideal foundation for applications that require user authentication and authorization.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can register by providing necessary information, including email and password.
  
- **User Login:** Registered users can securely log in to their accounts using their credentials.
  
- **Password Reset:** Users can request a password reset. A reset link is sent to the registered email address.

- **Email Verification:** A verification email is sent upon registration to verify the user's email address.

- **OTP-based Password Reset:** Users can reset their password by verifying their identity through a one-time password (OTP) sent to their email.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used to store user data securely.
  
- **Express.js:** A Node.js web application framework used for building robust APIs.
  
- **React.js:** A JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.
  
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development.

- **Nodemailer:** A module for Node.js applications that allows sending email.

- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Used for secure transmission of information between parties as a JSON object.
